The telecom company Interconnect would like to be able to forecast their churn of clients, in order to offer promotional codes and special plans to customers who may be planning to leave. 

We've got information about the customers regarding:
- The internet services they get
- The phone services they get
- The contract details
- Some personal details

After analyzing the data, we will prepare the data for predictive models, to predict who are the customers who may plan to leave the company in the future. We will train different kinds of models.

The metrics that will be used in this project are ROC AUC score, this will occur after we take care of the imbalanced data. And accuracy, which is the common score for classification purposed. The desired threshold is 0.88 for the ROC AUC score.
